# Byte Pair Encoding Implementations

A repo of byte pair encoding implementations, in order of increasing efficiency

## 1. Naive Implementation

A basic implementation of the BPE algorithm in Python.

## 2. Type Frequency

In this implementation we break the corpus into types (here this is words with punctuation, special characters and any leading white-space represented as Ġ).
